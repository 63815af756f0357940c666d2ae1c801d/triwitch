# triwitch
 minecraft (triplet) witch hut finder for specific seed

## Introduction
 Thanks https://github.com/hube12/MinecraftSeedCrackingC for their help in sturcture generation and https://github.com/Cubitect/cubiomes for ideas in biome generation.
 The generation of structure contains 2 parts: calculate the incomplete seed and then test if this position matches it.(The witch folder) After that, we need to check if the position is in swamp biome to determine whether it is a swamp hut.(The findtri folder)
 
## How to use
 Replace the "fullSeed" value with your own seed, and specific your search region. Redirect your screen output to a file, and then search this file to findout the triplet witch huts. You need to change paths in program.
 
## 9*Slime Finder
 Just change seed in 9slimechunks/SlimeSeed.java and run it.
 
## Environment
At least it works for Visual Studio 2017, Windows 7 x64.
