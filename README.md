# triwitch
 minecraft (triplet) witch hut finder for specific seed

## Introduction
 Thanks https://github.com/hube12/MinecraftSeedCrackingC for their help in sturcture generation and https://github.com/Cubitect/cubiomes for ideas in biome generation.
 The generation of structure contains 2 parts: calculate the incomplete seed and then test if this position matches it. After that, we need to check if the position is in swamp biome to determine whether it is a swamp hut.
 
## How to use
 Replace the "fullSeed" value with your own seed, and specific your search region. Redirect your screen output to a file, and then search this file to findout the triplet witch huts.
 
## Environment
At least it works for Visual Studio 2017, Windows 7 x64.
